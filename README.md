# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
I have done this project by taking the help of kaggle and geeks for geeks. I have downloaded the dataset from kaggle.com. This project lays emphasis to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.
